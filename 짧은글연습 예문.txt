No pain, no gain.


Hate the sin, love the sinner.


Keep focusing.


Rolling on the floor laughing.


Away from the keyboard.


Love begets love.  


Bring your own beverage.


You have to memory.


Patience conquers the world. 


The family is one of nature's masterpieces.


Like father, like son. 


Blood is thicker than water. 


The language of truth is simple. 


A friend in need is a friend indeed.


Old friend is better than two new ones. 


Slow and steady win the game. 


Don't cry before you are hurt. 


Books and friends should be few and good. 


Books cannot never teach the use of books.
